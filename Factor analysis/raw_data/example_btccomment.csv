4,Good or Bad - Blackrock Buying BTC,52,390,"Even now that the price of bitcoin is still below $70,000, there are people who are still unable to afford a whole bitcoin, which is never a problem and shouldn't be a problem.  Even if Blackrock and other financial institutions want to buy more bitcoin, the thing will still remain the same. You can only reduce the amount you will buy if the price goes all up, just as those who didn't buy when the price was below $30,000 have cut down their budget.  One thing you need to know is that the bitcoin price will always move up above where it is right now, with or without this blackrock purchase. They are just helping the process speed up a little bit, but the bitcoin price is going to remain stagnant, so if you have money to buy, use the opportunity of seeing it at a low price to accumulate what you can.","March 29, 2024, 09:53:37 PM",Orpichukwu,434,299

What if some day they started something along the lines of ""fractional banking"". Like starting to sell bitcoin IOUs to people and sell more than they have. For example if they actually owned 1 million bitcoin but sold 10 million IOUs. What would that do to bitcoin, its price and its future? That is the scary part...Today they're selling ETF IOUs to people that is supposedly 1:1 but who's to say it's going to remain this way...","March 30, 2024, 07:19:46 AM",pooya87,3402,10440

No matter how you feel about it, you can't influence the outcome or change it.You voiced the positive side - this is an increase in the price of bitcoin. The negative point is that too much bitcoins is concentrated in “one hand”, which is clearly not very good. It would be better if bitcoin was more distributed among smaller BTC-holders. If Blackrock (and other big holders) continue to accumulate bitcoin and not sell it, then this will further exacerbate the imbalance in the evenness of bitcoin distribution. Although the uniform distribution of bitcoin between holders looks like a utopia and is no longer possible to bring this to life. Due to the bitcoin concentration among big holders and the high cost of it, a cycle occurs, that is, the more expensive bitcoin, the less bitcoin small holders can afford and the more institutional investors buy bitcoin. It turns out to be a vicious circle in which big players become the dominant holders.","March 30, 2024, 08:03:10 AM",m2017,1764,1287

As a part of a free market, big players can also invest if they feel like it. But, thankfully, at this point Bitcoin is so huge that I don't think there's a single company that can accumulate such a truly significant amount that would allow them to monopolize the market and can significant control over it.Big funds investing in Bitcoin can both boost its price and reputation. And there's still plenty of BTC left to buy and store in non-custodial wallets. Yes, when the price goes up, it means people can afford smaller amounts of BTC than before.

They will also contribute to the increase in the price of the currency. Which means more money for long-time holders. Many people would never invest in Bitcoin directly except they use third parties. So it is good news for them since they can now invest through ETF. The disadvantages will be more centralisation which undermines the ideology of Bitcoin.

I think if they buy bitcoins surely the price of bitcoins will increase, popularity will increase and it will be stronger.If black rock company buys bitcoins and buys altcoins we do assume the price of all those coins will go up if so I will be very lucky here because I hold another coin besides bitcoin even though it is altcoin. I am sharing a picture here which I collected from a telegram channel. I am marking in red the two coins I bought.I am sharing the picture here true false you can consider. But the coin I buy and hold after Bitcoin I expect to be very successful with this coin.That's a token, not even an actual cryptocurrency and it is just another shittoken like thousands of others with no actual potential whatsoever. If you check out its chart you can clearly see that it also had its moment in the sun after its creation 3 years ago and it has been dumping ever since and staying dead until the recent fake hype with Blackrock that slightly pumped it.The best one can hope with shittokens like this is to see some fake hype leading to small pump. They are never good for ""investment"" though. Just for very quick pump and dump.","March 30, 2024, 05:25:49 PM",pooya87,3402,10440

Blackrock is not buying! They are buying ON BEHALF of their ETF customers. People keep talking about ETFs like it is the handful of investment firms that are buying up all this Bitcoin. Yes, they technically are the ones buying, but they are doing it with customers money, on the behalf of customers. So it isn't Blackrock buying up all this Bitcoin, it's myriad investors in the TradFi markets that are buying up the bitcoin through the ETFs.Secondly, ""it makes it harder for others not in the market yet to buy more amounts""...well, that is the case anytime anyone buys Bitcoin. If you follow that line of thought, then nobody should ever buy bitcoin because it'll make it harder for other people to buy bitcoin, therefore nobody owns bitcoin and it is worth $0 and doesn't exist anymore.There is no such thing as too much too soon. Bitcoin reached a mainstream global audience 7 years ago! So the average person has had 7 years to buy Bitcoin. It isn't the TradFi investors who are buying bitcoin through the ETFs fault that the vast majority of people still don't own bitcoin.The purpose of Bitcoin is not for everyone to get a great deal on Bitcoin. It's a currency - the purpose is to own it and use it. Everyone is able to choose if and when they decide to buy Bitcoin. Everyone who has wanted Bitcoin before the ETFs opened up Bitcoin to the US TradFi world already bought it. The ETF buyers are market participants just like anyone else (though of course they aren't holding bitcoin itself but holding it purely as an investment through a financial product). The people who haven't yet decided to own bitcoin don't get some sort of preference to get to buy it before TradFi people lol.

Blackrock or Microstrategy or Tesla are all bitcoin investors, which means they don't buy bitcoins just to hold them forever and not sell them. Have you ever thought about them selling all the bitcoins they accumulated to the market and what would happen then? It would certainly be terrible. In the past few days, when the amount of Bitcoin that Grayscale sold was greater than the amount of Bitcoin that ETFs bought, the price of bitcoin also decreased. And even a small amount of bitcoin can cause a decline, so if Blackrock sells a large amount, it will cause a huge panic in the market. Yes every sell from this big investors will definitely cause a market correction because of the excess supply they have. No investor that doesn’t know this, the market is of two phase the bearish and the bullish. So even if the blackrock decide to sell today which is logical it will still be a good thing because it means more buying opportunity and also a spread of the coin to other investors than them holding the junk of it. If one is scared of a drop then they should sell when they are in profit When blackrock and large funds sell their bitcoins, there are also 2 cases that happen. Those who bought bitcoin at higher prices will see this as a bad thing as the market is dumped and they fall into losses. On the contrary, those who want to accumulate more bitcoin will see this as a great opportunity to own bitcoin at a cheap price. That's why I often say that everything has its pros and cons. The fact that we have a large amount of capital participating in the market is not 100% good or bad.Our mission is to closely monitor market developments to come up with appropriate solutions to optimize profits, and that will depend on the mindset of each investor.

You can only reduce the amount you will buy if the price goes all up, just as those who didn't buy when the price was below $30,000 have cut down their budget.  One thing you need to know is that the bitcoin price will always move up above where it is right now, with or without this blackrock purchase. They are just helping the process speed up a little bit, but the bitcoin price is going to remain stagnant, so if you have money to buy, use the opportunity of seeing it at a low price to accumulate what you can.But it can be a problem in future. They will be very powerful and will control prices in future. This will make it hard for future investors to come into the market. However, not everything is bad about it.

Definitely, if big corporations hoard more bitcoin, its price will also increase as the demand goes up, but also, when there's a bright side, there will also be a shadow part or a bad part. For example, if blackrock really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin, if they decide to sell all their assets or just some assets, we will see a very big dip or movement in the market. But anyway, we will see what will happen in the market. As you've said, we can't stop them if they decide to hoard bitcoin. Crypto currency is a freedom, so we can't control or stop them.

Yeah you don't get the bitcoins, but you get the cash, when you sell the shares in the ETF. That's how ETFs work. Everyone buying a Bitcoin ETF knows thats how it works and they are choosing to do that. Nothing wrong with that. ETF customer buys shares of ETF and the ETF issuer uses that money to buy that amount of bitcoin on their behalf, ETF customer sells shares of ETF and ETF issuer sells that amount of bitcoin on their behalf, giving the customer the cash. Very straightforward. There's no problem with it.My point was that people at least write in posts on the internet about these ETFs as though they think its the actual investment firms buying up all this Bitcoin for themselves (which in itself would also be perfectly okay because ANYONE can own Bitcoin, remember bitcoin is all about being open, no gate keepers, nobody deciding who can own what, etc) but of course its not, its the investors who are buying the ETFs.

53,Good or Bad - Blackrock Buying BTC,52,390,"Quote from: Darker45 on March 31, 2024, 03:14:13 PMAs in everything else, this is both good and bad. Surely, this isn't entirely bad, but it isn't entirely good either. But it seems to me that if we put the good and bad on a scale, the bad might actually be heavier. It is, of course, good that Bitcoin is acknowledged, but how? Acknowledgement but only as a speculative asset means this kind of adoption is indeed both good and bad. Anyway, BlackRock isn't planning to buy everything. BlackRock is just an asset manager. It doesn't necessarily own what it keeps. Also, BlackRock probably doesn't care about Bitcoin itself. It only cares about making money. And if there's a way to earn from Bitcoin, then it wouldn't bother recognizing Bitcoin's popularity, but not its essence. It may not be right to call this situation good or bad, as you say. I think we will see how this situation will be in the coming years. For now, everyone knows the answer to the question of Bitcoin's recognition or whether Bitcoin will bring profit. Bitcoin proved itself a long time ago.There will always be institutions that look at Bitcoin only to make a profit. Bitcoin is an investment tool that every person and institution can access. The positive or negative effects of the actions of these institutions emerge later.",Today at 07:02:32 AM,eightdots,728,698

With Blackrock buying lots and lots of BTC. I consider this a catch 22 and a mix of good and bad.What are your thoughts on this?Sure for anyone who hodls  BTC and Blackrock buying more, value goes up. so it works for people already holding BTC.Yet it makes it harder for others not in the market yet to buy more amounts , they will have to consider buying less now if on a budget.Is this a case of too much too soon? or do you think Blackrock a good thing? thoughts?I have mixed feelings as well but I think we should try to look at the bright side of this: having big funds like BlackRock etc on bitcoin's side instead of against, is going to reassure many people that bitcoin is actually something legit and not a scam. It could accelerate bitcoin's adoption. Of course I know that people who are buying the ETFs are (probably) not going to buy and use the actual bitcoins but this is all free advertisement at the end.Yes, we should look on the bright side because even if we disagree, we have no way to stop BlackRock or the big funds from buying bitcoin. And the fact that we always look at the negative side only makes us disadvantaged and does not bring us any benefits. I also thought that when ETFs was approved, large funds would hold the majority of bitcoin and this would make bitcoin more centralized and easier to manipulate. But I know there's nothing else I can do to stop it, so I'll look on the bright side and use it as motivation to push bitcoin prices higher. I will take advantage of that to make bigger profits instead of trying to fight back desperately.Yeah, have a point. Definitely, if big corporations hoard more bitcoin, its price will also increase as the demand goes up, but also, when there's a bright side, there will also be a shadow part or a bad part. For example, if blackrock really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin,really wants to buy all bitcoin, other investors will also not have a chance to buy their own, and if one company holds the majority of bitcoin, if they decide to sell all their assets or just some assets, we will see a very big dip or movement in the market. But anyway, we will see what will happen in the market. As you've said, we can't stop them if they decide to hoard bitcoin. Crypto currency is a freedom, so we can't control or stop them. All we can do is also take advantage of that movement.This is the financial market and what we need to do is create the most profit for ourselves, not thinking too much about things that we cannot change or intervene. Similarly, in addition to blackrock and funds entering the market, governments will also soon introduce regulations for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market. What else can we do to change that? We can't do anything but keep quiet and follow the rules. So instead, let's adapt and think about what plan will benefit us the most when those things happen.",Today at 10:49:26 AM,Ayers,2576,1022

SEC confirmed Bitcoin ETFs because there was pressure from companies like BlackRock. Their involvement is good for making Bitcoin more popular, adopted and expensive. Expensive Bitcoin means higher profit for early holders but this massive adoption and an open door with BlackRock comes with one disadvantage and that's the slow centralization of Bitcoin. When centralized companies offer centralized services with Bitcoin, we are losing decentralization and Bitcoin's main value is decentralization. It doesn't mean that centralization will make BTC cheap but the problem is that Bitcoin will not be a good payment method.",Today at 12:33:22 PM,shield132,2170,837

Bitcoin holders will try their best to ensure things goes smoothly on their ends, none of us wouldn't appreciate ourselves with good entries on bitcoin especially when we're giving the golden opportunities to do so. We should be looking at the brighter side because it comes with a whole lot of sacrifice and there's definitely no going back when one already spotted a bold moves in the system. Seriously to me it is not complicated, if only you want to make it less complicated yourself. The whole idea around it and I mean bitcoin is to make money things easy for every one. Instead of just been an electronic P2P, many saw the opportunity to generate ROI from it over a long term holding. This is where many people have complicated it, you don’t need to invest all your funds in it and expecting a pump. The best way is to invest what can actually afford, secure it in a good wallet and allow it to run and nothing more.

I've never run out of patience with Bitcoin since I understand how the cycle works, emotions in this space is no more in me because I have been into this market since 2017 and I know exactly how market works.Also it depends on the type of an investor you are, I am into Bitcoin investment not just to make some money but to build my empire with Bitcoin, I want my retirement around Bitcoin, for someone like me there is no reason to rush or wish for anything fast.Most emotions get built up when you aren't making money from another source, always make sure you have something going on financially in your life, investments do take years to get good results.","March 25, 2024, 11:38:05 AM",Crypt0Gore,812,260

I think there is no harm in deciding to sell bitcoin in a situation like this. Because I personally think this action is a very good thing, rather than having to borrow money from other people or banks.So I personally would not blame investors who are not strong enough to hold Bitcoin because of family needs.That's why, when investing in Bitcoin, we should use cold hard cash, and we should have emergency money, as well as savings. Because if these three aspects are not implemented well, then when economic conditions or financial conditions are not good, the solution taken will definitely only be to sell bitcoin.And for example about network congestion, slanted news, and falling bitcoin prices. Only then is this really not worthy of being used as material to make us sell bitcoin. Because it's just something that will return to normal in a relatively short time. So don't panic or be afraid when this happens. However, I emphasize again, the family needs factor cannot be avoided.

Anything can happen anytime so we need to make enquiry before we intend to buy and store Bitcoin so we could understand the market a bit so our investment would not lose value over a short period of time. The future if Bitcoin is brighter so we should not be disappointed about what is happening since we are already in the bull market. It is highly expected specially in this track of money exchange. That is why you should only to put yourself to a risk that you can tolerate. Do not put your money that you aren't willing to lose. And only hold it in a matter of time that fits your conviction. Time is your ally. And during this time of bull market, trend is your ally too. Holding time is less and you just need yourself to avoid picking tops. Because if you truly invested on a project that will improve over years, then minor fluctuations on the daily shouldn't be scare you from your investments.","March 30, 2024, 11:25:37 PM",Natsuu,1078,158

In fact, risk and reward are linked especially in the crypto space. However, the big question is whether the risk is worth taking. There is no investment totally freed from risk but the risk associated with bitcoin is second to none ranging from market crash, transaction delay and of course, falling victim to hackers. I don't blame anyone when I see them turning back on cryptocurrency despite not the best choice to make. There's actually a potential gain in the long run if one can endure through the dark period.However, I won't agree with the Op that investors should overlook all these shortcomings and focus only on the brighter side. It's good to pay attention to every bit of aspect and derive a measure to balance the situation. That doesn't sound like an investment advice because risk are not equally created.","March 31, 2024, 10:02:21 AM",knowngunman,560,300

Anybody that is investing without think of the risk attached to it, will fail in that investment. So we should consider the other side of bitcoin and not only the bright side, to help us know how much to put in, and how to make sure our investments are safe. Yeah, people who often make their decisions without looking at both sides have to face the consequences of doing that. If someone is going for a long-term investment in Bitcoin, they might not need to worry much, but if someone is willing to take short-term profits from it, they are supposed to look at both sides of the coin, they need to understand that if it's up right now, it can go down as well, or if it's down, how long will I need to wait before I can get my investment released?Nothing in the world is permanent, everything has an end.

You'll notice that in past halvings the price of Bitcoin was much lower when it took place in April, and the price that herbing took place during that time immediately increased by three to four times that price as evidenced by the 2020 halving. Bitcoin price peaked in 2021 at 69K, but 2024 saw a record high without halving and holding so Bitcoin price touched 73K, the all-time high.

Decentralization gives people the freedom to use money the way they want without restrictions placed by the government. It also promotes privacy which enables individuals to hide their financial transactions or worth. Currently, Bitcoin is used more as an investment than a currency. In most countries where it is popular it is hardly used to pay for goods and services but many people use it as a speculative asset. Although the currency could be bought in bits which gives people the opportunity to buy based on their income many people still cannot afford to buy it. In the future, I also think that it will be difficult for low-income earners to have access to it. So I doubt if Bitcoin will promote an equitable and inclusive financial system.Bitcoin promotes decentralization but from the way institutional investors are rushing into the sector, centralisation is now becoming the order of the day. Many people are now attracted to investment packages offered by some ETF providers instead of having the keys to their investment. Maybe things will turn out better in the future.

Any information which you think it’s private, once it’s stored online, then it’s no longer private, anybody can have access to it, and it might be the wrong person that will have access to it. Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on March 24, 2024, 12:56:53 PM* How do I go about letting my friend know about such a habit of taking and keeping screenshots on his device that I have observed and warn him about it, without looking like I sense bad days coming?It’s easy, walk to him, and talk to him about the behavior, or are you scared of your friend? If you are not scared, then just talk to him. I think that’s just the only thing which you can do. ","March 25, 2024, 03:34:54 PM",Issa56,1330,870
251,How safe is saving screenshots of useful information and BTC transactions?,61,433,"yes it is necessary to screenshot every transaction you make, either Bitcoin transaction or bank transaction is very important to screenshot it. when we're still using binance in Nigeria, I pay for a particular coin, the seller of the coins do not want to release the coin for me, I chart him up that he should release coins that I have paid, no response so I quickly go to appeal, and they asked me where is the screenshot of my payment. I forward it to them immediately and binance write him that within one hours, we should settle our seif immediately he released the coin.  so if not the that I screenshot the payment receipt, that is how my money would have Lost.","March 26, 2024, 03:16:38 PM",Bonny070,25,0

I believe that the best thing to do would be not doing this at all, but if he insists on doing this then at least tell him to have some backup plan, that would be a lot better and would give him a greater return, it would definitely allow him to get a better return in the end as well.","March 27, 2024, 08:31:24 AM",justdimin,2954,670
253,How safe is saving screenshots of useful information and BTC transactions?,61,433,"A person who is into P2P trading must take and send screenshots of the transactions being sent and receive screenshots of transactions being received because that is necessary as it works as proof between the parties about the money sent or received.Other than that, if a person takes screenshots of sensitive information such as their account balance, how much Bitcoin they have, etc. That can be dangerous sometimes because you might become a target for robbers and stalkers, and you might even get attacked. Some mobiles don't let users take screenshots of sensitive screens such as when you are using your banking app, etc.So, if your friend takes screenshots of passwords and other sensitive information, that might become an issue for him if he loses his mobile, otherwise, he must know what he is doing.",Today at 09:29:52 AM,wiss19,2072,337

If he had forgotten about such important information and hands his device to anyone close or someone who normally has access to his device, it could pose a threat to the success of his trading journey. Still he may point me to the fact that saving screenshots is the only way he can quickly resolve his disputes and save time.It still doesn't change the fact that these screenshots are just ordinary images and can not be used to sign into your wallet or whatsoever. Most at times, people take screenshot for reference purposes. So taking screenshot of his transaction doesn't have any consequences itself that will make someone to be panic. I know it would be better to avoid it if one can because of the risk that may likely be associated with it if you mistakenly share it publicly but again, this depends on the circle of people you live among.Your friend is already used to it as you said and how it has vindicated him previously with dealing with some traders. The only thing I think you can do now is to caution him to be careful and limit the way he allows people to have access to his phone. There's no direct effect of screenshot taking but just like you assume in the Op, it could make someone a target for hackers and probably physical attack since people have the mentality that you're rich once you are into crypto trading.By the way, what happened to auto generated trx hash? Isn't that enough evidence as far as crypto is concern? ",Today at 09:59:09 AM,knowngunman,560,300

You will tell him that crypto scammers are very intelligent and cryptocurrency is not like other stuff he does and shows online. You should tell him things that he would keep secret. He should show everything. However, I believe if he did that, you would have known since the other ones he did, but still, I will say you should advise him.Although you are not trying to teach him what he is about, whether it is trading or investing, you should just advise him to keep things secret to avoid being scammed.

For your useful information, there are many ways you can store it in your phone, and you won't get any problems. It just remains for you how you handle your device. If you are giving people your phone, like if many people get access to your device, there is definitely a problem, especially your seed phrase and private key. These are the most important things you should keep safe in your phone because they are the things that will make someone get access to your funds, so you just have to keep your device safe because they are the things that will make someone get access to your funds, so you just have to keep your device safe and know the kind of people you give your device to.",Today at 12:01:03 PM,Dzwaafu11,476,317

For these, the 256Mb version is recommendedCPU:i7-7700K CPU: ~22 Mkeys/s | using 8 threads [-t 8] Many thanks to DaveF who has collected the vast majority of the data here. It was thanks to him that I decided to put this data here and express my willingness to supplement it with more items. If you have equipment that is not listed above - I will be grateful for info on its performance in VanitySearch (version with integrated BitCrack options). If you have the equipment listed above and you managed to get better performance - also let us know how you did it (additional start command, gridsize etc.) for the update.Latest VanitySearch builds with BitCrack features working on all NVIDIA cardsCompilations made with the use of CUDA version 11.6, so for the program to work it is necessary to update the drivers in the system to the latest ones that are available.

By the time someone else comes up with a new or modified program, the next key will be cracked by then.Guess the gpu pollard multi-gpu 2021 maybe, and any other bitcrack multi-gpu edition 2021 maybe, and vgen ultraspeed only in dev's hands. but jean_luc is still the bomb all else said oclvgen.thanks for your response big","March 13, 2020, 12:47:54 AM",dextronomous,427,105

A lot of time has been spent on rewriting the sources, I constantly change it. Added verification of GPU output data in secp256k1 before writing to files.

Each jump requires 1 inversion by modulus, since the distance is not known in advance where to jump and it is calculated by dividing it with the remainder of the PointX coordinate on DPmodulo - this is repeated after each jump in each stream. And now, count how many inversions you need to do and please read about this mathematical function. It takes a lot of processor time, since it is necessary to do many mathematical operations with 256 bit numbers for 1 inversion modulo. You do not compare the Polard algorithm with VanitySearch (and bitcrack), in which 1 inversion is done for 1024 keys using the Montgomery’s trick, since the step is known in advance - it is a delta from 0 to -512 and from 0 to +512. Check out the GPU code.  Accordingly, the speed can be tens of times different!you are talking about code, its P kangroo, you are right at your own way, i am talking code running at hardware structure space, as first kangroo was by pinkachunka at bitcrack, his stats was 100 bit in 3 days, and your 90 bit are shown for 8 days, he uses full power of GPU, mean full space by useing bitcrack switches, he uses 15.9gb during workout, and your ram used is 5.5gb , maybe you need expand table size or design by hardware structure switches, where maximum result for less time","April 01, 2020, 11:29:31 PM",brainless,307,34

This are the time to spent by CPU.Could you share you results for #50?Just when power is set 12 for bit 50, it turns out Hop_module 41 is 1 long jump 2 ^ 41 - it's too far and the range of selected points goes far from bit 50. Accordingly, the search time will be much longer. Also, when a large power - DP parity / DPmodule becomes less than 18, which leads to a large amount of data received from the video card and errors occur, wild and tame files grow quickly. Accordingly, it also affects negatively. The optimum size of the DPmodule is 22 - 24 of these values ​​should be selected power. And if DPmodule is large, then fewer selected points will be saved in files and search time will increase. Therefore, it is installed no more than 24.+ the comparator starts the comparison once every half a minute. Therefore, such a total time.All noted. Thanks.

But here they use probabilityof a point being distinguished is 2 ^ 20. In another solution, a multiple of 2 ^ 29 was used.There should be some logical explanation for DPmodule selection. 2^20 or 2^29 will not be the same depending on the private key bits length. I mean that 2^20 could be optimal for 110bits key, but not good for 150bits key. 2^20 is more than 1 million - so we use only x-coordinates with factor 2^20 for our collission comprator, but possibly skip earlier collisions.DPmodule selection is something like the balancing between calculation power and saving/comparator power. Extreme example: if we select DPmodule = 1, we will save every jump, so we will need more storage space, and also the more stored places we have the harder work for comparator. From the other hand we will catch ""the 1st meeting between wild and tame kangaroos"". Selecting greater DPmodule we will have less saved points, easier work for comparator but we can skip the actual meeting (i.e. collision we are looking for) between wild and tame kangaroos.alek76, Can you please examine this in more details and find the logical exaplanation why the DPmodule for x-coordinate is used and how to select the optimal value for this module based on bits length of the key (or other factor if required)","April 07, 2020, 02:55:03 PM",MrFreeDragon,443,350

Just gotta try and try again. Pick an number and let it run. Wait til it either fails or you run out of patience. Rinse. Repeat. (that is if you're looking to recover your old wallet, doncha know).---On another note, I think I figured out how to set a range instead of just using a number for -bits. Haven't let an extensive test run yet but worth an experiment.

I went over with a speed of 1600 Mkey, and in 8 hours about 46,000,000,000,000 passwords, our final range of 18446744073709551615 turns out, 5 more numbers in front, this is a lot.Maybe my maths is wrong, I certainly mess things up with the hex-dec conversions... Maybe it's more like 17%?My BitCrack console window currently says:Code:Ellesmere        768 / 8192MB | 1 target 150.12 MKey/s (1,655,689,975,443,750,912 total) [15:17:01:05]So if I am reading this correctly, that's 1.65 x 10^18 keys checked.And the keyspace is approx 9.22 x 10^18 in size?  I used a hex calculator to subtract the ff[..] from 80[..] and came up with that number in decimal equivalent.  Maybe that's where I went wrongMy friend, you aren't even close...the pool that has been running for over a year, with Billions of Keys per second with hundreds of V100s has only searched about 11 percent of the entire range.

But to just solve for #120 is a waste, IMO. Target 120 through 160, at least the range, then all wilds can be tamed and all be in the same range not in lower 1/32 range. Also, if you have 256 3080s, mere 1.2 BTC is nothing and you are obviously in it for mining, but if you only have 1 and you have friends who have 1, that is the combining power effect where maybe you can net more than mining with 1 card. Who knows. It's fun, it's a challenge, next one breaks the world record...The #64 pool is only as good as the number of people who sign up for it and actually run their rigs for awhile.

No planning to go for AMD card  because I have RX 480 rig and still running now, it's so noisy and higher power consumption.

I alone can throw billions of addresses, but why are they empty?The goal is to find the keys corresponding to the specified addresses, not to make money. The found address is not a specified one but it is helpful for those who are trying to find the base encryption algorithm. The private key is in the specified range and can be useful in generation algorithm study. One is to do math and another is to do brute force, but both work.

JeanLucPons is busy with other projects (his professional life is more than working on another program) and therefore not active in other programming projects. I will probably start work on # 120 with JeanLucPons in due course, but I don't know when it will happen at the moment.how long would it take in that interval? ---> 8147ae147ae147ae:828f5c28f5c28f5c","March 28, 2021, 08:26:13 PM",CanalGanheAgora,24,0

Handing over this bonus from the pool of my current share of the prize is still a small amount, but from the point of view of new willing participants - my result does not encourage to start - what this small part that I decided to add to the bonus pool - I hope will change. As for the warranty - I am not the owner of the pool, but from the very beginning I am in constant contact with its owner and I also archive all correspondence. Pool has already existed for a while, so its disappearance is impossible without a trace, and the act you are talking about would be a crime that would not be a problem to detect. I will not mention any other issues, such as the age of the ttdsales.com domain (it was created in 2004, so it was not just for the purpose of the pool). Moreover, my results from the scanned ranges - I decided to transfer to the pool several months ago, therefore I fully trust the owner as to his intentions and I am sure of them, bearing in mind the above.

Nevertheless, I encourage you to join us at ttdsales.com/64bitNot sure what was confusing about the interface. If you need help understanding, I am here to assist.It is easy to understand.If you have the #64 space, ttd breaks it down into 2^32 ranges (I believe), so ranges are randomly selected and assigned to users; so it will take 2^32 searches to touch the entire 64 bit range. The other pool breaks the entire range down where users search 2^19 ranges (considered 1 round, spread out over the entire #64 range) and search 2^32 keys within each range. After the 2^19 ranges have been searched, the next start range is shifted by beginning range 8000000000000000 + 2^32. Next start range would be 8000000000000000 + 2^32 + 2^32, next start range, etc.. In this way, every space of #64 is touched, every round. It is merely a different concept versus ttd. I understand you have a lot invested with ttd's pool, so of course you will want people to join it where you have a large majority of ranges searched. But it was setup this way so that users with 1 GPU could continually run their GPU and compete with people like you who bring online massive amount of work-related/server type GPUs, for periods of time. It was designed so even the slowest single GPU could complete a range in under a minute.Another difference was the software. ttd's pool uses old bitcrack, single GPU only, unless you run multiple instances (pain in the neck) OR you can use the modified VS Bitcrack that your buddy wrote for you long ago and then you can use multiple GPUs. The other pool was using a far superior program, a different version of VS. The other pool, had a bonus for the finder as well, built into the numbers.When the pool was running and had users, the stability was not poor, it was up and running 24/7. Once users declined and I had 99% of searched ranges (took months to get to that point), I took it off-line but continue to work it, from time to time. Mining is too good right now ($$$) for most with GPU power to want to participate in any #64 pool, myself included.","April 12, 2022, 04:46:25 PM",WanderingPhilospher,1022,217

614,== Bitcoin challenge transaction: ~1000 BTC total bounty to solvers! ==UPDATED==,966,45795,"Quote from: WanderingPhilospher on April 12, 2022, 04:46:25 PMQuote from: zielar on April 11, 2022, 12:29:28 AMA few days ago I checked this pool, but I didn't really understand the principle of operation and even the scoreboard itself. Back then I didn't have time to write more about it, and now that I have - the server of this field is not working, so apart from the unclear interface - the stability is poor. Nevertheless, I encourage you to join us at ttdsales.com/64bitNot sure what was confusing about the interface. If you need help understanding, I am here to assist.It is easy to understand.If you have the #64 space, ttd breaks it down into 2^32 ranges (I believe), so ranges are randomly selected and assigned to users; so it will take 2^32 searches to touch the entire 64 bit range. The other pool breaks the entire range down where users search 2^19 ranges (considered 1 round, spread out over the entire #64 range) and search 2^32 keys within each range. After the 2^19 ranges have been searched, the next start range is shifted by beginning range 8000000000000000 + 2^32. Next start range would be 8000000000000000 + 2^32 + 2^32, next start range, etc.. In this way, every space of #64 is touched, every round. It is merely a different concept versus ttd. I understand you have a lot invested with ttd's pool, so of course you will want people to join it where you have a large majority of ranges searched. But it was setup this way so that users with 1 GPU could continually run their GPU and compete with people like you who bring online massive amount of work-related/server type GPUs, for periods of time. It was designed so even the slowest single GPU could complete a range in under a minute.Another difference was the software. ttd's pool uses old bitcrack, single GPU only, unless you run multiple instances (pain in the neck) OR you can use the modified VS Bitcrack that your buddy wrote for you long ago and then you can use multiple GPUs. The other pool was using a far superior program, a different version of VS. The other pool, had a bonus for the finder as well, built into the numbers.When the pool was running and had users, the stability was not poor, it was up and running 24/7. Once users declined and I had 99% of searched ranges (took months to get to that point), I took it off-line but continue to work it, from time to time. Mining is too good right now ($$$) for most with GPU power to want to participate in any #64 pool, myself included.My only suggestion was that the Pool is not available all the time (for whatever reasons) which makes participating [or creating a competitive] unattractive. That's right - I put a lot of strength into ttd and that's why I'm going to work for this pool, but not only because I put a lot of effort into looking for it, but also because regardless of the situation - the pool has a 100% uptime, so who wants to be clear conditions to join and continue your work or even start, where the same regardless of when it started - if you find the right key (and the chance is greater because the range where the key is missing is already eliminated) - me and the author have a $ 500 bonus . After all, it would be obvious that no one would start working seeing how many scans I have already scanned without a bonus :-)Quote from: BwtException on April 15, 2022, 08:27:46 PMQuote from: WanderingPhilospher on April 12, 2022, 04:46:25 PMIf you have the #64 space, ttd breaks it down into 2^32 ranges (I believe), so ranges are randomly selected and assigned to users; so it will take 2^32 searches to touch the entire 64 bit range.

Do you know what the data below ""Distribution for each 16th of the entire 64 - 63 bit range"" means?Is that how many keys where tried in each key range?This is a general picture of the situation showing how many percent of what part of the entire range has already been scanned. The entire range of 64 is divided into 16 sub-ranges. The percentage indicator shows, for example, that the 16th part of the main range (i.e. F80000: FFFFFF) was scanned in almost 40%.Quote from: bane77 on April 18, 2022, 02:04:32 PMQuote from: fxsniper on April 01, 2021, 05:19:38 AMQuote from: WanderingPhilospher on April 01, 2021, 02:44:02 AM I am having to do a string search versus full address search because a few of those cards are the RTX 3070 cards.

what number of same characters of address would be needed to get 9/10 missing characters of priv. key so  you can brute force it than?The ratio of the characters of the address (or the initial prefix) to the value of the characters of the private key or the general distribution throughout the entire range of the pool is completely random, so whatever you write about - it probably doesn't lead to

Back then I didn't have time to write more about it, and now that I have - the server of this field is not working, so apart from the unclear interface - the stability is poor. Nevertheless, I encourage you to join us at ttdsales.com/64bitNot sure what was confusing about the interface. If you need help understanding, I am here to assist.It is easy to understand.If you have the #64 space, ttd breaks it down into 2^32 ranges (I believe), so ranges are randomly selected and assigned to users; so it will take 2^32 searches to touch the entire 64 bit range. The other pool breaks the entire range down where users search 2^19 ranges (considered 1 round, spread out over the entire #64 range) and search 2^32 keys within each range. After the 2^19 ranges have been searched, the next start range is shifted by beginning range 8000000000000000 + 2^32. Next start range would be 8000000000000000 + 2^32 + 2^32, next start range, etc.. In this way, every space of #64 is touched, every round. It is merely a different concept versus ttd. I understand you have a lot invested with ttd's pool, so of course you will want people to join it where you have a large majority of ranges searched. But it was setup this way so that users with 1 GPU could continually run their GPU and compete with people like you who bring online massive amount of work-related/server type GPUs, for periods of time. It was designed so even the slowest single GPU could complete a range in under a minute.Another difference was the software. ttd's pool uses old bitcrack, single GPU only, unless you run multiple instances (pain in the neck) OR you can use the modified VS Bitcrack that your buddy wrote for you long ago and then you can use multiple GPUs. The other pool was using a far superior program, a different version of VS. The other pool, had a bonus for the finder as well, built into the numbers.When the pool was running and had users, the stability was not poor, it was up and running 24/7. Once users declined and I had 99% of searched ranges (took months to get to that point), I took it off-line but continue to work it, from time to time. Mining is too good right now ($$$) for most with GPU power to want to participate in any #64 pool, myself included.My only suggestion was that the Pool is not available all the time (for whatever reasons) which makes participating [or creating a competitive] unattractive. That's right - I put a lot of strength into ttd and that's why I'm going to work for this pool, but not only because I put a lot of effort into looking for it, but also because regardless of the situation - the pool has a 100% uptime, so who wants to be clear conditions to join and continue your work or even start, where the same regardless of when it started - if you find the right key (and the chance is greater because the range where the key is missing is already eliminated) - me and the author have a $ 500 bonus . After all, it would be obvious that no one would start working seeing how many scans I have already scanned without a bonus :-)Quote from: BwtException on April 15, 2022, 08:27:46 PMQuote from: WanderingPhilospher on April 12, 2022, 04:46:25 PMIf you have the #64 space, ttd breaks it down into 2^32 ranges (I believe), so ranges are randomly selected and assigned to users; so it will take 2^32 searches to touch the entire 64 bit range.

what number of same characters of address would be needed to get 9/10 missing characters of priv. key so  you can brute force it than?The ratio of the characters of the address (or the initial prefix) to the value of the characters of the private key or the general distribution throughout the entire range of the pool is completely random, so whatever you write about - it probably doesn't lead to anything :-)Sry  if my questions r stupid, but i just started to learn about BTC/Crypto,... Anyway  i was referring to wif priv. key, so how did you get first 7 characters which r the same of BTC puzzle address and my question was how many more characters of the address would be needed to get like 10 missing characters of wif priv. key. Cos in your poast first 7 characters of the address correspond to first 33 characters of priv. key-missing 19 characters? Or this is not the case? Thanks!","April 21, 2022, 05:55:27 AM",bane77,17,0

The prices of these cards are so high that it is definitely not profitable to buy at least one for this type of workload.Personally, if I had to invest in a GPU for such loads - I would choose the RTX3090 because:a) it achieves a MUCH higher hashrate b) you will buy MUCH more RTX3090 than this ONE Tesla.","April 29, 2022, 04:06:48 PM",zielar,277,106

Apart from the fact that you tire your GPU with the parameters you specify (not to mention the MKeys / s speed) - let me also remind you that VanitySearch has better performance when it comes to MKeys / s.As for the right question of my predecessor - any not too old card will be good. At the current stage of development of all the above-mentioned applications - it is definitely worth paying attention to NVIDIA cards, because they are reliable on these cards, which cannot be mentioned about the OpenCL support that only BitCrack provides, and in addition with a different effect.A colleague in front of me is somewhat misleading, because there was no question about how many cards he must have to find the key, but what card he must have in order to start participation, and these are two different issues. The same in terms of profitability. As you can see on the ttdsales.com/64bit/ pool, which is actively working to find the key to # 64 - apart from me, there is also a group of people who with little power, but still support the search, because each already proven range falls out of the pool of possibilities, and what a hence -> the number of possible ranges is constantly decreasing, but if in the end the correct key is found by these smaller participants (because the chance for this is greater with every moment when subsequent empty ranges fall off) - apart from the prize resulting from the score table - the participant will receive such a Pool owner bonus of $ 500 + from me another $ 500, so even entering the participation with little power -> you can get rich with a bit of luck by a minimum of $ 1000, and I will just mention that 16% of the range has already been checked.As part of the development of this topic - I will gladly update the main post with the GPU performance charts in terms of speed achieved along with the best settings for both programs listed beside.I remember that some time ago someone created something like that, taking into account the price of the GPU and the price-performance ratio, but I don't remember if it was in any of the previous topics on this challenge, such as VanitySearch, BitCrack or elsewhere, but if anyone remembers - I would be grateful for pointing to the link in order to be able to start developing the base version of this list.

This has no effect on performance. When buying a used one, it is worth knowing what the card was used for during its use (i.e. whether it was used as a graphics card in the computer or used for crypto mining). the same new.2) The participants can decide on their own to what extent the parties they want to be allocated. For example - the VanitySearch configuration file consists of five lines, as in the example on my one machine:Code:zielar-gpu -gpuId 0,1,2 -t 00xC0000000xFFFFFFF16which in turn means for the program: 1. my login 2. commands for vanitysearch for selected processors 0,1,2 and excluding CPU usage, 3. Lowest selected range, 4. Maximum selected range, 5. Number of simultaneously downloaded ranges (i.e. I download 16 ranges at once to eliminate connecting to the pool every single range)3) The specific scanned ranges are not published for obvious reasons which, apart from their huge number, include issues that eliminate the support of people not participating in the pool. Working for a pool is about bringing their members closer to the correct key, not letting outsiders know which ranges are already checked and empty. Thanks to this also - the pool has an advantage over people who will try their luck [in the form of already such a large resource of proven ranges], and as a colleague wrote earlier - the full range is huge. This 16% consists of more than 21 million sub-ranges that the Pool has already scanned, while the full sub-range pool is 134,217,728.However, you can see the estimated distribution of the scanned sub-ranges in the table after logging in, divided into 16 parts - from which you can see, for example, that the final (F80000-FFFFFF) range is already scanned in 45%, while the initial (80000-87FFFF) only in 4%. This information, however, is so useless for outsiders, because the correct key is only one and it can still lie in the still unchecked part of the last range, while the very percentage discrepancy from the beginning to the end results from the fact that I insisted on the second half of the range and as I wished, the system assigned me sub-ranges from the second half to be scanned.P.S. As a curiosity, I will only mention that today I switched to the initial ranges, because my whim regarding the sub-ranges has changed Quote from: WanderingPhilospher on May 09, 2022, 02:10:49 PMQuote from: zielar on May 09, 2022, 01:09:03 PMAs part of the development of this topic - I will gladly update the main post with the GPU performance charts in terms of speed achieved along with the best settings for both programs listed beside.I remember that some time ago someone created something like that, taking into account the price of the GPU and the price-performance ratio, but I don't remember if it was in any of the previous topics on this challenge, such as VanitySearch, BitCrack or elsewhere, but if anyone remembers - I would be grateful for pointing to the link in order to be able to start developing the base version of this list.

I may be right, or wrong..but do you what.. just continue searching this wrong private key. and you will regrit one day. this is only 16 keys. if you run your normal computer without any Gpu for one week searching random 16 keys, you supposed to find this damn pk..i told you bro. there is something wrong with this pk.Haha, you did not disappoint me. You say it is not true, yet many keys have already been found. Also, you cannot run a normal computer with CPU only and search the entire 64 bit range in only 7 days. This lets me know you really have no idea what you are talking about...sorry to disappoint you.If you know of a normal computer that can search roughly 2^61 keys a day, let me know...","June 06, 2022, 06:30:53 AM",WanderingPhilospher,1022,217

These are fundamentals of cryptography. every body knows about that. It seems you are new in this market.Who told you when you search 64 bit range randomly you may repeat the same key several times.that is impossible unless you used very bad random program...if that possible why it doesn't repeat the key of puzzle 64...just use your mind.I am just trying to rise your awareness but you don't understand.Puzzle 65 and so on..I know they used the public key..but the question is who exposed the publickey, the creator. Who found, some guy called zeilar(I think, I am not sure). Zeilar is one of them. They doing all these just to give legal cover, so you think it is true.Ok, I forget something..Do you know how many computers are searching this puzzle?Millions of computers..If every computer searches randomly, believe me one of them must get the key.(if the puzzle is true).Lol...thanks for the good laughs, I needed it today!","June 07, 2022, 12:16:46 PM",WanderingPhilospher,1022,217

683,== Bitcoin challenge transaction: ~1000 BTC total bounty to solvers! ==UPDATED==,966,45795,"Hello I am the creator of the 64 bit pool.  I just saw zielars post.  We worked together quite a lot in the time the pool was trying to find the solution. Started Oct 31st 2019.  The pool was able to check 19.9% of the possible range totaling 1,836 Quadrillion private keys checked.  As soon as the solution was posted on this forum the first thing I did was check the pools database and confirmed that it was not solved on our pool.  It wasn't.  One fear I had is that it would be found by a user on the pool and they would move the funds before I would be able to.  The database proves that is not what happened.  Bit 64 was solved by someone completely off pool.  It is unfortunate but the truth just the same.  Below is a DB snippet for 100 ranges before and after the range containing the winning key.  Zielar was the closest on both sides. 20 ranges in front of and 38 ranges behind.Code:+-----------+------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------+---------+-----------+| id        | rangestart       | proof                              |

The probability of generating 1002 in 1000 different numbers is 0.001%, which is a small range.If we want it to generate 32 different digits, the probability of generating the number 1002 increases. It is a probability of 0.032%.Now if we consider that these numbers are divided into bits, for example;1000-12501250-15001500-17501750-2000Currently, the probability of finding the number 1002 is 0.128%, in fact it is not only the probability of finding the number 1002, but the probability of finding all numbers between 1000-2000.I want to show it as a small picture. Because it's very brain tiring.https://ibb.co/9w0LS0kThe starting wallets in a sequential fashion were colored in exchange for each bit of them.As there are 4 different wallets, 4 different colors were used.https://ibb.co/GnHGsyTHere, however, each created wallet is colors with a specific function.I will explain in more detail as a result of some studies.

If it's for measuring the world's brute forcing capacity, 161-256 are just a waste (RIPEMD160 entropy is filled by 160, and by all of P2PKH Bitcoin). The puzzle creator could improve the puzzle's utility without bringing in any extra funds from outside - just spend 161-256 across to the unsolved portion 51-160, and roughly treble the puzzle's content density.If on the other hand there's a pattern to find... well... that's awfully open-ended... can we have a hint or two? I am the creator.You are quite right, 161-256 are silly.  I honestly just did not think of this.  What is especially embarrassing, is this did not occur to me once, in two years.  By way of excuse, I was not really thinking much about the puzzle at all.I will make up for two years of stupidity.  I will spend from 161-256 to the unsolved parts, as you suggest.  In addition, I intend to add further funds.  My aim is to boost the density by a factor of 10, from 0.001*length(key) to 0.01*length(key).  Probably in the next few weeks.  At any rate, when I next have an extended period of quiet and calm, to construct the new transaction carefully.A few words about the puzzle.  There is no pattern.  It is just consecutive keys from a deterministic wallet (masked with leading 000...0001 to set difficulty).  It is simply a crude measuring instrument, of the cracking strength of the community.Finally, I wish to express appreciation of the efforts of all developers of new cracking tools and technology.  The ""large bitcoin collider"" is especially innovative and interesting!","December 12, 2022, 07:16:35 PM",CryptoGPU,17,7

I haven't figured out a pure GPU method of initial key production, either.   Right!Yeah, I played with it a year or so ago and the GPU is not ideal. Python is the purest form of generating 1 random at a time (that I have played with and used, maybe something in C would work faster, maybe albert0bsd could create something), versus generating random starting keys and checking x amount from the starting key until it's rekeyed. Even the CPU with these programs doesn't create a random key and check and a new random key and check...the CPU still creates random starting keys, etc. My VBC can solve a 36 bit pretty fast in random mode, but that is a small space compared to 66 bit and beyond.

The ranges are selected randomly however, if a user selects to run 16 ranges in their settings file, then those 16 ranges are sequential.TTD's pool averages anywhere from 50 to 91 * 2^40 ranges ran in an hour.It will be interesting:a) if the pool and myself actually keep plugging along at #66b) if a = true, which method will find the key firstc) if I don't change up my plan in the next hour, LOLd) someone else gets lucky (which is all part of it), finds it firstTBC...looks just like this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5166284.msg52304416#msg52304416Nah, not really...you said ""I distribute the scan over the 20-3F keyspace, pick 3 random bytes"" whereas my program just randomly generates roughly 800,000 new random key starting points every minute and then sequentially checks 2^20 keys from each random key starting point.I have kept track of random keys and it looks like it is spreading the wealth well;

I saved every random starting point and added FFFFF to each one to show the ranges and keys checked in those 8 hours.That is only 15+ trillion keys checked in total, but they are all spread out over the 66-69 bit range.If you want to look at what this single card was able to accomplish in 8 hours, you can download the text file here and look at all the different ranges searched.The file has been sorted for easier viewing.link:https://easyupload.io/tyeppzpassword:BTCChallengeLet me know if you have any issues trying to download the text file.

It would be great if we could build an algorithm specifically designed to do the same for addresses only, this way we wouldn't need to count from 1 up to 2^256, we'd only need to represent 2^160.8 (more or less) total number of addresses with hexadecimal values, so when you search for the address #0 you'd get Code:1111111111111111111114oLvT2 for #1 you'd get Code:11111111111111111111BZbvjr and so on until you reach the end of the address range. This is just for entertainment and would have no use case for storing bitcoins because you don't know the private keys, you might only know the private keys which you had generated before, i.e, using a wallet etc.If we could manage to do something like that, imagine the awe of the beholder! Being present at such a mesmerizing sight!Just don't forget to include my address on the footer of the site for donations, make sure to name me as the cofounder . Lol.And remember, no offensive words, no sacrilegious words, we wouldn't wanna upset the boss up stairs, so we should skip 4 to 8 percent of addresses.

The finder wishes to remain anonymous2. Someone has a tool to find #125 soon3. The withdrawal was made by someone outside the forum4. Someone has some other purpose in it, so as not to reveal themselves.It is certainly puzzling that BCH and BTG have not been paid out from this wallet so far, while the payment was made to the address without any other transaction before, nor was it sent further - which also raises the suspicion that the finder could use some tool that worked for a long time -> found the right key and made the withdrawal, but the initiator himself still does not know that he found solution #120. A lot of unknowns, but I believe that eventually someone will somehow provide a solution, because the solution #120 without indicating the key to the public will simply be a blow to the whole history of these puzzles.","March 06, 2023, 01:01:05 AM",zielar,277,106

I've been doing this for at least 2 years.

What are the estimates that a pubkeys lookup for 29 addresses with this method and this program at this speed will yield the intended expectations more than a traditional key lookup? What are the real chances of success and effectiveness of this method?Hi ZielarWaouhh impressive this speed! If you could choose the beginning and end of the search range, you could find pubkey #66 between 2 and 4 months. On the other hand the search is carried out randomly it makes random hashes on the PK of #64 #66 #67 #68 #69 #71 and #72 it can be faster as well as much longer depending on luck. Too bad this program could be largely optimized like choosing the hash range #66 as well as the random or sequential mode with your speed you could come across #66 in 1 month or 2 depending on luck.EditLooking more closely at the operation of this utility and your speed, the proba are thesein 10 days on all the beaches by inserting the 6 pubkeys (I calculated for the first 6 # not 29)  you have a one in 148 chance of having one of the keysin 20 days 1/74  1.35%in 40 days 1/37  2.75%in 80 days 1/18  5.5%in 160 days 1/9  11%in 320 days 1/4  25%it remains arbitrary because luck can enormously speed up the process ","May 02, 2023, 11:51:59 AMLast edit: May 02, 2023, 03:15:26 PM by Lolo54",Lolo54,117,32

I'm curious.Switch x coordinate of that key and try again, remember whenever you have a private key, try to directly add or subtract with it for less confusion.This way you should always change x coordinate of the result, because for example if you change the x of #125 from 02 to 03 in order to subtract something from it, the result could be -n key if the key you are trying to subtract from it is smaller than #125.E.g. I subtracted ""F"" (15 decimal) from #125 by adding F to 03 x coordinate of #125, therefore the result is 03bb7d0fd320386226ff713108a743b3d2885e9f77f17da6654f40ae2a712af5d7Now if you try to add anything to it, you'd be further subtracting from the puzzle key, turn 03 into 02 and add F to it to reach #125.Now this key 0302157655af8bb1decd37d161aa92cc7050cae1d6b4f44e4aa04507e3c1855159Is actually -n so you need to add the key above to it in order to subtract from it, now in ECC, subtracting a small key from a greater key or vice versa has the same result, just different x coordinate.You could try to understand this by using a normal calculator, subtract 30 from 10, you will get -20.Quote from: WanderingPhilospher on June 10, 2023, 06:08:27 PMYeah those sissy programs are doing pure mathematics BUT doing it 10000000000+ times faster than you and not becoming confused after 100 pubkeys.

You should know whenever you generate an address, you are actually generating 4 addresses which you could use, but only can control 2 addresses with your key unless you subtract the key from N to obtain -n of your private key.In ECC, those large private keys are just negative numbers, till you reach the middle range, meaning half of all private keys are negatives, the other half are positives.So, as I said earlier, in order to subtract a private key from your public key, it's best to switch x coordinate and also switching the x coordinate of the result because it would be -n and as you did yesterday, subtracting something from a -n key will actually add the 2 keys together, also adding to a -n key as I said will subtract from the +n version of your key.

If I'm right it could help a lot in further lowering the bit range, this has taken me more than 45 days and I am still not sure.Maybe, maybe one way to figure out if we are subtracting too much from #125, would be to start subtracting a bigger key and keep reducing it's size very carefully till we see a -n key as a result,  though because of this mod thingy it is extremely difficult to determine if the result is -n or not.Chop chop guys, the rich and wealthy are about to use their silicon wares and grab our loot, we need to step up our game.😉","June 11, 2023, 04:22:53 AM",digaran,1330,899

BTW, there are no privet keys 'with a minus sign ""-""!'There is a chain of lols in this page and previous one.Don't let the looks of private keys deceive you.This is N FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141Now in order to find the inverse of your private key, just subtract it from N and you will have negative x coordinate of your private key. You should know whenever you generate an address, you are actually generating 4 addresses which you could use, but only can control 2 addresses with your key unless you subtract the key from N to obtain -n of your private key.In ECC, those large private keys are just negative numbers, till you reach the middle range, meaning half of all private keys are negatives, the other half are positives.So, as I said earlier, in order to subtract a private key from your public key, it's best to switch x coordinate and also switching the x coordinate of the result because it would be -n and as you did yesterday, subtracting something from a -n key will actually add the 2 keys together, also adding to a -n key as I said will subtract from the +n version of your key. You should use another calculator which shows, accepts public keys with 02 and 03, this way you won't get confused as to whether you are adding or subtracting.Quote from: WanderingPhilospher on June 10, 2023, 07:30:21 PMJust stop lol. Read what he said. You can’t subtract a private key, a private key, from a public key. Yes, you have to convert the private key to a public key before subtracting it from another public key. All those programs you are calling sissy, do math like you are doing.  You can just multiply G by any number in one go, adding or subtracting and I'm not talking about under the hood as you like to say, but manually you can just add 2 private keys directly to have a resulting public key, though you don't have to manually convert a private key into a public key and then try math operations on them.Also, do kangaroo and BSGS do any division? If they are not, then they are useless, if they do then again they are useless because by dividing properly, you should find a key in a much much shorter period of time.However I'm guessing kangaroo might do division but ECC doesn't bend so easily.Quote from: Denis_Hitov on June 10, 2023, 07:49:01 PMQuote from: bestie1549 on June 10, 2023, 07:34:31 PMSo If I have to start from a range on BSGS according to your mathematical calculations, which key is the closest that you almost thought could have hit puzzle 125... lets search within that range on BSGS. then we can all share some funds together too.The closest one is 03ed01ff219ed5c1afc12d991a82e3063ddcee1fd53b46f7cad52a0d87a7112aed, it should be searched for in the 124 range.This key you call the closest one could have a size half the 2^124.I might be wrong but somehow I can say with 50% certainty that #125 starts with 0x1c. If I'm right it could help a lot in further lowering the bit range, this has taken me more than 45 days and I am still not sure.Maybe, maybe one way to figure out if we are subtracting too much from #125, would be to start subtracting a bigger key and keep reducing it's size very carefully till we see a -n key as a result,  though because of this mod thingy it is extremely difficult to determine if the result is -n or not.Chop chop guys, the rich and wealthy are about to use their silicon wares and grab our loot, we need to step up our game.😉You really need to understand EC keys converted to private keys. How it is not reversible without a massive amount of computing power. Power that we don't have today, with even just the public key. The public key is hashed from the EC key and is not very simply hashed back to EC. From that hash the address is created. The hash will be completely different if 1 digit is changed. Sure if you have the EC key its easy. This is why Bitcoin is secure. 1 way conversion to a public key that cannot be converted back to a private key, the private key is derived from the base EC key.We are trying the find the EC key that has been put into reach because of the ton of zero's in front of the EC key, making the operation simpler but still difficuilt.If you want to play around with EC keys and double hashing for keys read up and run libbitcoin tools.

( I'm not there yet though).Another thing you could do is division, if you multiply  my +n public key with this :Code:7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff5d576e7357a4501ddfe92f46681b20a0Since my +n private key ends with 9 when converted to decimal, multiplying it by the key above would divide my -n key by 2 because the -n key ends with 8 and is an even number which we could divide by 2, however if you add G or 1 to my +n key it will become an even number and you could divide it.Furthermore, when you are dividing a key by N/2 aka the above key, it doesn't matter which key you are using, either +n or -n would do the same, only if the +n is even, otherwise good luck running on a never ending loop of divisions.Sometimes, when you are subtracting from a puzzle public key, some of the results are even numbers, you could divide them by 2, that way you'd be 50% ahead of the game.Here is another trick you didn't know about, when you are using key sub tool, if you do -a -s together and then subtract the 2 keys which are next to each other, one has # - something and one has # + something, subtracting those 2 public keys would result in double of your target key. Be careful when you do that because the key before # - sign is -n, subtracting it from any key means addition, just switch it's x coordinate if it is 02, change it to 03 and if it is 03 change it to 02 before doing the subtraction, you would know you are doing it right when you multiply your target by 2 and having it to compare with the results of your subtraction.There now, you have just learned 1 year worth of going to university  in 30 minutes. 🤣Ps, I wonder, if I know all these stuff, why can't I do any jack? These questions keep me up at days, since I sleep at nights. Lol^125.","June 13, 2023, 02:27:19 AM",digaran,1330,899

I wouldn't waste my time with findings based on similarity of addresses, just because a public key has a somewhat similar address to another key which we know is in 66 bit range doesn't mean the key of that address is in the same bit range.  There could be billions of such addresses in 2^255+ range, should you go and search there if we find a look a like address in those ranges?If solving a puzzle was that easy by just comparing addresses with each other!!! More equipped people would have taken the coins long ago.  Actually lowering the bit range down to 66 bit is as difficult as solving DLP.Though if you have spare resources, I could ask to go for a certain key whenever I am sure about it's exact range.😉","June 13, 2023, 08:51:18 PM",digaran,1330,899

And math is the language of the universe and order, we humans do better with the things that were here before we existed, but trying to work with the things we created? Not a good idea, not only we can't learn anything from them, we'd become more dumb as many studies prove that human race is becoming dumber due to the excessive use of technology, lol.  Imagine 50 years from now asking a 15 years old  what is 25 + 4?

995,== Bitcoin challenge transaction: ~1000 BTC total bounty to solvers! ==UPDATED==,966,45795,"I have a question, is it even possible to brute force a key  like puzzle #121? If it's possible I wonder what would be the cost?And if the cost is more than the prize, no use, if the cost is less than the prize, again no use or purpose for designing this puzzle.Think about it, revealing the exact range of every puzzle in order to see if people could brute force them while either the cost is more than the prize or less,  this doesn't make any sense and has no reasonable purpose honestly.It wouldn't even prove anything, because it's obvious brute forcing keys especially 256 bit keys without known public key is impossible even if you know the estimated range as this challenge is the evidence.So in my opinion working on any puzzle is a waste of time and effort if the prize is less than the cost, having a bigger prize than the cost of solving a key is also nonsense, because what? I have enough money and could use GPUs to solve a puzzle in order to earn something more than I have spent? And if I have the money and calculate the cost to see it's not worth it, I would never attempt to solve a puzzle.I think @Satoshi, or the actual designer of this puzzle should rethink and revise the purpose of this challenge.Imagine even if the whole world wanted to brute force a 256 bit key, they'd have to guess the range blindly and keep searching forever.It would be nice to have unsolved puzzles above #67 moved to higher bit ranges with their public keys exposed, because I don't think there is any shortcut to solve a  key with no known public key other than brute forcing sequentially, though having a public key is at least something we could work with and improve on existing tools.No public key = waste of time.","June 17, 2023, 12:29:18 PM",digaran,1330,899

Our file wil contain around 2^23.05 tame kangaroos that is randomly distributed and continue their path.After working file ready we must change the public key in the this file to the one of interest.Also we need a version of kangaroo that produce only wild kangaroo, we don't need new tame kangaroo anymore.Don`t forget that we need change the public key in the working file every time when change interest.So every time we start with the same working file that contain only tame kangaroos but with changed public key in file.And kangaroo programm got job from this working file.For testing i a use randomly generated public keys in range 2^74, some are very close to the beginning, some near the end.Here is result:Expected operations: 2^38.47Code:[728.59 MK/s][GPU 728.59 MK/s][Count 2^37.44][Dead 2][04:49 (Avg 08:41)][347.2/440.5MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x03B043758AC54072BB816BDE28ECF833560D85286E1D86A3CD365C76882A8C87C6       Priv: 0x402E66057958F4E9E0E       [727.18 MK/s][GPU 727.18 MK/s][Count 2^37.41][Dead 0][04:43 (Avg 08:42)][345.2/438.0MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x02633305FFE6B6238982F24044C864479C8A7DCFF444D7B9446732617F888D788B       Priv: 0x414C10C6D7D89F38873       [730.19 MK/s][GPU 730.19 MK/s][Count 2^36.35][Dead 0][02:15 (Avg 08:40)][300.8/382.5MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x026ACEBA7AD37487DFAF24CAFE4302B379C3688ACA7CF332DC0FFB9050EA72F27F       Priv: 0x46D59B75FE1AD6FCBB3       [749.64 MK/s][GPU 749.64 MK/s][Count 2^34.70][Dead 0][42s (Avg 08:26)][273.1/347.9MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x036E152745E2CB09DDA8F0E8FE5E6939111F751895E5E222EF50E25361E4751702       Priv: 0x49CA4F75FC4DD4A0E98[736.65 MK/s][GPU 736.65 MK/s][Count 2^36.19][Dead 0][02:01 (Avg 08:35)][296.6/377.3MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x02AE1FDEF6FB06E68EAAC3E0342A65E37ADDE369AD82B2C5B41AAE488A6C30BB48       Priv: 0x539F9F353128FA9E829       [730.97 MK/s][GPU 730.97 MK/s][Count 2^36.92][Dead 0][03:20 (Avg 08:39)][320.5/407.2MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x022E7A857A9891F872A4610396FCAE10AC638B0D89D588B127A3C1423DA41174EF       Priv: 0x554AEDB740506B9EFD1       [729.24 MK/s][GPU 729.24 MK/s][Count 2^37.33][Dead 0][04:27 (Avg 08:40)][340.6/432.2MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x027BBD8C6F41B43046A3E128037326EEC9807EC767C20E9529CD51034B5361963E       Priv: 0x6BDFFBDB6411F328BB9[738.33 MK/s][GPU 738.33 MK/s][Count 2^34.87][Dead 0][48s (Avg 08:34)][274.7/349.9MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x020DFBA9B7C4D7A53A6EE985AB11ACC06BEACC47EBC53D0751B455323F21CBD1B6       Priv: 0x6D9D613445EFF402945[741.74 MK/s][GPU 741.74 MK/s][Count 2^36.69][Dead 1][02:50 (Avg 08:32)][311.9/396.4MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x022FCF70783B01AE1EDDE1CAD273926E089D65CDC4D1510A5C642D9E10A527743F       Priv: 0x71C02F72D735ABC20C9       [733.28 MK/s][GPU 733.28 MK/s][Count 2^35.80][Dead 0][01:33 (Avg 08:38)][288.1/366.6MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x026893801A8A18773DEC6C166C8E9081B09FB6B724F8D3B9825E5C20EDEA9085D6       Priv: 0x7A54720FF5235105605[722.31 MK/s][GPU 722.31 MK/s][Count 2^36.94][Dead 0][03:26 (Avg 08:45)][321.7/408.6MB]Key# 0 [1S]Pub:  0x03150058CFFA65835192FBC8076C40377355189A810D04150882578E55FEB50672       Priv: 0x7DBA59C1B7ACF79825E       As you can see all time we do not reach even expected operations/2We do not count tame kangaroos that were produced once at the beginning.Can you explain in more detail how to prepare a working file?Than it can be opened for viewing and editing.And of course, where to get a version of kangaroo that only creates wild kangaroos.","June 20, 2023, 02:42:36 PM",sssergy2705,188,0

I remember there used to be a wif-solver-cuda program for wif, but is there such a program for hex private key?It doesn't matter that the keys are in HEX.

The core will skip it and you can watch the real addresses in debug.txtAfter import the entire blockchain will rescan. Addresses will be updated to WIF. It takes a few hours. You can do this offline. During this time you can monitor debug.txt in ./bitcoin for any added transactions to the keys you imported.I think I have done about 20,000-40,000 keys from raw data. Speed is only slightly impaired with a massive amount of keys. The core does have its limits however and anything over 40,000 keys at a time will probably brick it.I am also sure you could use known addresses to compare and skip this information.

I understood itLol, weren't you satoshi himself just yesterday? You should already know all the keys of all puzzles!My estimations are rounded up numbers and they could be inversed/ backwards, since I calculate from greater keys down the bit range, I could be 99.99% off the correct path, I am still working on validating the exact range, though if the puzzle key was out of the 2^125 range, like in 128 bit, I could tell according to my calculations.The keys and their value representations I provided above are for simplicity, though we could calculate the keys based on decimal values of bit ranges.For example, we could consider 2^124 as 16 in decimal and 2^125 as 32, we could as well call 2^124  ""21"" in decimal, I chose to represent 2^124 as 1000 in decimal.The other miscalculation of mine could be due to the fact that I focus on hexadecimal representation of keys too much, therefore I could have confused the hex characters with their mirror versions, i.e, if we divide ""a"" by 2, we would get 5, dividing 1 by 2 will result in ""e"" and depending on each character on the right side of a hex character, the result of dividing them could differ and cause more confusion, which is why I might be off with my numbers.One thing I have failed so far to figure out, is to subtract a key from another key to land on a rounded key. But my random logic and random numbers stop me from moving forward.😉","June 30, 2023, 11:32:16 PM",digaran,1330,899

And then this is not a guarantee that the desired key is not in the range. For good in this case, need to search using BSGS. However, searching for a key using BSGS in the range of 109 bits is too resource-intensive, many times more resource-intensive than kangaroo.So maybe someone can offer an alternative solution to this problem.","July 10, 2023, 08:14:44 AM",Etar,616,312

It has easy answers, with public key you can solve thousands of times faster, without public key, you either go directly to brute force all the keys in the range, or you'd go breaking 2 hash functions just to reach the public key, so it is more wise to skip all the drama and stick with the easy way.I'd say up to puzzle 79 is solvable in a few years given the price going up to make it worth the effort, however even puzzle #159 can be cracked  with special ASICs as long as the prize is more than the cost, I suspect that we will never see more than #79 solved in our life time and this puzzle will remain a legacy among other achievements of Satoshi for the future generations!","July 10, 2023, 10:48:13 AM",digaran,1330,899

Talk about standing on the shoulder of giants!~one loveEdit: sorry ripemdhash I forgot to try to answer your question. Pretty sure 63 to 64 was solved last September. I saw it guesstimated you have about a 2^10 higher probability of using pollard rho theory opposed to brute forcing. Idk if thats accurate but i'm convinced brute forcing isn't the way. The best GPU's going right now are probably the H100 and the RTX6000 ADA.

I want for fun reduce puzzle key #125 to total of 100 bits. Can anyone tell me the steps? AND tell me if this is actually possible? lol.. I know i will land on tons new pub keys but is there a program that reduce bits ?  you can try fraction-bsgs or fraction-kangaroo it do what you need.Step1 substruct range begin from public keyStep2 devide G by 2^24, it will be fractionStep3 devide public key by 2^24, it was first public key to serach in range 1.. 2^100Step4 substuct fraction from first public key , it wil be second public key to searchStep5 substruct fraction from second public key.......In simple numbers how it work. For ex. our desired key is 379 that lie in range 2^9We want search in range 2^6=64,  divisor is 2^3=8Devide 379/8 = 47,375fraction = 1/8 = 0,125Stage 0 search 47,375 in range 2^6 => result negativeStage 1 subtract from it 0,125 => 47.25, search  in range 2^6 => result negative.Stage 2 subtract from it 0,125 => 47.125, search  in range 2^6 => result negative.Stage 3 subtract from it 0,125 => 47, search  in range 2^6 => result positive.So now we need multiply 47 by divisor 2^3=8 = 376 and add stage number =>376 +3 = 379Desired key 379 founded in 3 stage of 8From myself that if you are not lucky, then this is a bad idea, very bad idea.With kangaroo puzzle#125 need +/- 2^63 op.With division you will have 2^24 public keys with search range 2^100 that need 2^51 op (maxstep 2) for every pub.Total 2^24*2^51=2^75 op  and this is not a guarantee that the key will be found due to maxstep.it still sounds complicated, you can use the example of 130 puzzles to write commands on how to break it into parts, and what command to look for in each part.","August 13, 2023, 09:29:39 AM",tgfx,4,0

Still not much changed in the last 15 years - ATI5970, 3200 cores at 800 Mhz,today top card, only 5-6 times that, with double the frequency, and 20x times the cost. Ok, it has crazy amount of RAM and bandwidth, i am sureit is important for harvesting people private data, too bad is not much use for us. I honestly believed some 20 years ago when trying to bruteforcea TEA key(only 8 bytes), that in the future we will be able to flip 64 bits in a second with ease. The biggest cluster i have personally run was only 20 video cards(10 machines), a friend run like 1500 cards, and that was a nightmare to maintain.As for scaling up, the only option is to have some kind of server/arbiter/job manager, written in higher language that splits the keyspace into verysmall chunks that serve to nodes for crunching, and then verify, barely trust the results. Because hw tricks are simply not enough if you'll be drawing MW from the power grid and pay people to maintain your racks.","August 13, 2023, 10:57:40 AM",678AFDB0,12,3

It will run with a GUI, and you can let it work in the background, so if one of the adr. is in future doing a txid, you will get a update on it in a seperate file.Main goal is to be first, if puzzle adr. maybe do a txid in future, and you can snap the pubkey from it first.Hope you understand what i mean.Look at puzzle 74 nothing happend long time, no pubkey was known, and then a txid was made at 4 am, and at 23 pm it was cleand.

See if the grid size finds the key or not.I use a similiar version of KeyHunt Cuda / Rotor and haven't missed a key with a large grid size.

I implemented a total key counter in mine. It would print to file, total # of keys, that way, even if power went out, I'd have a good starting point.If you do it this way, make sure you keep/know start and end range. You then need to take total keys ran, divide by the number of threads (grid size) and then take that number and add it to your initial/last start AND end range.Example:If you had a start range of 0 and an end range of 1000000 (keep it small for this purpose) and your grid size was 10x10. The program says you have ran/checked 10,000 keys total.Take 10,000 (total keys) and divide by 10x10=100 (grid size); 10,000 / 100 = 100. So each gpu thread checked 100 keys. So for your next batch file, you would have a start/end range of 100:1000100.If you only change the start range by 100, then you are overlapping/possibly missing keys checked on the other threads. If you stop and think about it, or do the math, it'll make sense.Your first thread checked 0-100 (now on second run it should start at 100 and be on the hook to check up to 10,100); the last thread checked 990,000-990,100. If you don't adjust the end range as well, your last thread will now be checking 999,900 instead of starting where it left off at 990,100.Lol, again, if you do the math you'll understand.

That is, the creator surely has the public key as he surely has the private key. Otherwise, someone would have used kangaroos long time ago, if pubKey was known.I think it's pointless to ""brute-force"" the pubKey. I assume what you are thinking is somewhere along the lines:1. Find some 256-bit number X (32 bytes) that results in RIPE(SHA('03' | X)) = decodeBase58(address)2. Use ECDLP solver on P(X, y(X)) since you know it has a known long prefix.Flaws- you assume that there's only one X that results in the first equality. Chances are 1 in 2**96 that you'll get an X corresponding to a 66-bit private key. There's 2**256 SHA hashes that map to 2**160 RIPE hashes, so 1 address can be obtained (in theory) in 2**96 ways.One of those 2**96 X's is the one having a 66-bit key. Most of all others will be in the 256-bit range.- you're limited by SHA256 computing power of the hardware. Assuming you're after finding a collision, and let's say you have some GPUs providing 10 GH/s you're still looking at around 100 years of more until you find such a collision, which only guarantees you some 1 in 2**96 rate of success.So to speed-up your search by a factor of 2**96, you'll need to brute-force the private key in order to do (correctly):RIPE(SHA('03' | P.x)) = decodeBase58(address)where P is the public key of the private key.It will still take you same amount of time due to SHA limit above, but you have the guarantee of success.Good luck.","March 10, 2024, 01:21:08 PM",kTimesG,19,2

1212,== Bitcoin challenge transaction: ~1000 BTC total bounty to solvers! ==UPDATED==,966,45795,"Hi.Three years ago i first heard about the puzzle. At first i was interested in reading about this, then i started solving it. I was looking for software, formulas, theories, like all the other solvers, i developed a lot of my own software. I bought and rented gpus, cpus, servers, but did not give up, because solving the puzzle would help me solve some financial difficulties. I didn't notice how the first year passed.The idea of opening the puzzle took hold of me and it turned into an addiction. I'm not a gambler, never liked it, but puzzles turned out to be a much more severe addiction, because i always had the feeling that everything depended on my knowledge and perseverance, and not on luck. But i was wrong.I tried to stop many times, talked about it with a psychologist, came up with various forms of prohibition, but this only fueled in me a greater desire to solve at least one puzzle.At work, i became inattentive, i was demoted, then fired altogether, because i did not perceive new information well and no longer met the required level. I got into debt because i couldn’t get a good job again, i started taking medications that the doctor prescribed for me, but it didn’t help. Six months ago i developed insomnia, became nervous, and almost stopped communicating with my wife, although i wanted to. Three months ago she couldn’t stand it and left me. I sold almost everything to pay off some of my debts and survive. In 2 weeks, i am going of my own free will for three months to a clinic for people with mental disorders. This is the only thing that will help me avoid going to court for failure to pay bank debts and gives me hope that under the supervision of doctors and in complete isolation i will be able to get rid of this addiction.I don’t know how many people created the puzzle, who you are, what goals you actually pursue, but one thing i can tell you is that even the most insignificant idea at first glance always has consequences. When creating such toys as a puzzle, you did't think about others. The reward that is stored in every wallet is a bait that can become poison for someone.I want to blame you, but i can't, because i'm not an evil person. Perhaps i will feel better that i have told you all this.Maybe you think something like ""just do your job and don't look at puzzle"" - please, stop, you just know nothing about the disease of addiction.If you can, please help me close at least some of my debts. My wallet is bc1q7pp4h4wc8p8czajfkwc7sc049d9vyrc8ftnct2If you don't, i'll understand.This message is for everyone - know your limits before.I won't respond to messages in the thread because i'm embarrassed, sorry.","March 22, 2024, 05:49:38 PM",vega.aa,5,0

I just hope it wasn't sitting and watching the screen while brute force tools were running.  Knowing the ways you tried will definitely help others not to try them, you can at least do that.Oh, i feel naked in the middle of the street...At first it was really just an observation of brute force, because i did not fully understand the strategy of “attacking” with random numbers. Then I started modifying the existing software. Finally, i came up with my own software.I am an engineer, not a programmer or mathematician, i had to study, so most of the time i rather struggled with technologies that were new to me.Addiction began to appear when i felt that i was influencing the process. More like an obsession.I will have access to the code on monday. In fact, i didn’t come up with anything totally new, i just came to this conclusion:I ran hundreds of tests and simulations and found that if a number is divided into ""chunks"", the probability of hitting the target increases many times. For example:1 0000 0000 00000000What we see: the first digit is the starting number of the hex key. If we take, for example, the 66th key, then this number can be 2 or 3. A little later i will explain what i did in this case.The second and third groups have a range from 0000 to ffff, so, 65536 options.I generate two random numbers, convert them to hex, concatenate them and pass them to a modified rotor-cuda so that it can iterate through the remaining 8 values. The resulting range for example:1fb1206ac0000ffff1fb1206acffff0000I never iterate over the full value of 00000000-ffffffff because the likelihood of there being 4 zeros or 4 ""f"" at the beginning is extremely small.If in the first chunk we generate a number within 65536**2 (1 00000000 00000000), and not two separate values 0-65535, then the simulation shows that getting into a number within 4 billion is much more difficult than hitting two numbers 0-65535 twice. Mathematics often says the opposite, but i only believe the simulation, which showed me that in this case it is much more likely.Having a cluster of servers and an orchestrator that gave each GPU a group of new random numbers, it took me 2-4 seconds to brute force the tail of each key. Up to 40 GPUs worked simultaneously (as much as there was enough money for rent).If the number starts with 2-3, i went through the values twice, changing the starting digit.The second and third chunks are saved into a regular text document as one value, so the generator never hits the numbers twice and wastes no time. The maximum size of this document would be only 39 gigabytes.I understand that going through all 4 billion options would take many lives, but my system seemed to me the only one possible in terms of probability and i still believe that it would have worked, but i no longer have the money for further experiments.I've attached my text document with all the ~1.4 millions of chunks that i checked on the 66th key. I checked both - with 2 and 3 at the beginning. The tail, of course, was checked by brute force.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EeEMjnQ_6xa9S_88zPSr8OELCNkwXL3o/view?usp=sharingHope it helps someone.It will be very funny if my code didn't work well.

A single observation out of a gazllion choices, each with identical probability?Statistics work long-term, you can't have a conclusion from a single expected result.A key with value 0xFFFFFFF....F has exactly the same chances as any other random key.

Views are converted.I know. The way we see it, numbers look visually simpler than hexadecimal. I didn't say that the results are different.I don't need to prove to anyone what i see, but if it helps someone, the logic is simple:Imagine a slot machine. It has 1 slot with 65536**2 options. One generation = one rotation.The pseudocode is simple:Code:long a = rand(1, 65536**2);int count = 0;while (True) {        count++;        if (rand(1, 65536**2) == a) {                a = rand(1, 65536**2);                count = 0;                print(count);        }}Now try the same thing, but with two slots of 65536. I already said earlier that, despite the identical number of options, paradoxically, the frequency of two numbers appearing in a row of short numbers is in most cases much higher than only one, but long number.This works up to the third or fourth ""slot"". The more there are, the less chance there is. Thus, generating all 8 characters results in almost zero chance of ""catching"" the desired value if you not exclude a second hit.There is no need to guess one value out of extra large. You can significantly narrow the search if you combine ranges and brute force. That's all what i'm talking about.In the case of the 66th key, the range is reduced from 2*4294967296*4294967296 to 4294967296.The ranges that are in the text document above cost me over $60k. If someone tells me that this helped him narrow down his search and he found the key, of course i won't be happy for him, but maybe it's comforting to know that i screwed up so that someone else wouldn't (no).There is nothing more to talk here, it's over.
